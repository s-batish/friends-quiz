# Friends Quiz
'The One with the Ultimate Friends Quiz' is a multiple choice quiz for those interested in the TV show 'Friends'. Each game consists of 10 questions, with a 20 second timer for each question, with points being awarded for correct answers and how quickly those questions were answered, making this a game of both speed and 'Friends' knowledge.

## Design

### Colour Scheme
The purple and yellow colours have been used because of their connotations with the TV show 'Friends' and so have been chosen to tie into the theme of the quiz and also because they would be instantly recognisable colours to a fan of the programme.
### Typography
- The font 'Gloria Hallelujah' has been used for the title of the quiz because of its similarity to the 'Friends' logo.
- 'Cherry Swash' has been used for the headings, buttons and questions, and 'Montserrat' has been used for the answers and paragraph elements because they complement each other quite well and create an easy to read, but visually appealing quiz.
## Features
This quiz has been designed to be both entertaining and easy to use, and as such, the features that have been implemented across the game support this objective.
### Home page
-  This is what the user will be greeted with upon opening the quiz, and also what they will return to any time they click a button to return Home.

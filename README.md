# Friends Quiz
'The One with the Ultimate Friends Quiz' is a multiple choice quiz for those interested in the TV show 'Friends'. Each game consists of 10 questions, with a 20 second timer for each question, with points being awarded for correct answers and how quickly those questions were answered, making this a game of both speed and 'Friends' knowledge.

## User Experience
### Site Owner's Goals

- To enable users to compete against their friends and family through the High Scores section, which makes it easy for users to see their previous scores and improve
- To provide a fully responsive quiz that can be played on a range of devices
### External User's Goals

- To have clear instructions about the rules of the game and how the scoring works
- To easily navigate the site and to have a way to return to the Home page at any point of the quiz
## Design
### Wireframes
Balsamiq wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop devices to show the structure and overall design of each page of the quiz.

### Colour Scheme
The purple and yellow colours have been used because of their connotations with the TV show 'Friends' and so have been chosen to tie into the theme of the quiz and also because they would be instantly recognisable colours to a fan of the programme.
### Typography
- The font 'Gloria Hallelujah' has been used for the title of the quiz because of its similarity to the 'Friends' logo.
- 'Cherry Swash' has been used for the headings, buttons and questions, and 'Montserrat' has been used for the answers and paragraph elements because they complement each other quite well and create an easy to read, but visually appealing quiz.
## Features
This quiz has been designed to be both entertaining and easy to use, and as such, the features that have been implemented across the game support this objective.
### Home page
-  This is what the user will be greeted with upon opening the quiz, and also what they will return to any time they click a button to return Home.
- It is an easy to navigate Home page, with the title of the quiz at the top, and 3 buttons below:
    
    - A Play button to start the quiz

### High scores section
- This page displays the top 5 high scores in order from the highest at the top, to the 5th highest at the bottom.
- As the scores are only saved to local storage, users can only compete with those who play on the same device.
- There is a Clear high scores button which will clear the local storage and reload the window, taking the user back to the home page once this is clicked.
- The user can also move their mouse over each of the high scores which will enlarge them slightly as the mouse is hovering over it, which draws a bit more attention to the high score that the user is looking at.
